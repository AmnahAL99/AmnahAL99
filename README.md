### Hi there, I'm Amnah! 👋

I'm a passionate Software Tester dedicated to ensuring quality and excellence in every line of code. With a keen eye for detail and a relentless pursuit of perfection, I specialize in crafting automated tests that challenge assumptions and push software to its limits.

🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing automation frameworks using tools like Selenium and Playwright to streamline the testing process and improve software reliability.

🌱 I’m on a continuous learning path, diving deep into the latest testing methodologies,  and exploring innovative tools and technologies in the world of software testing.

👨‍💻 All of my projects are available on GitHub.

⚡ Fun fact: I believe that finding a bug is like solving a mystery, and I love every moment of the detective work.
